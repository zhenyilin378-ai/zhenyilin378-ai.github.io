      subtitle: ""

        My research explores the interaction between **political elites and voters**, with a focus on legislative politics, public opinion, and political behavior. I am particularly interested in how voters perceive and evaluate position changes by legislators and how these evaluations shape democratic representation.  

        My work has appeared in journals such as Journal of Electoral Studies and *Taiwanese Journal of Political Science*, and I have presented papers at major conferences including the **American Political Science Association Annual Meeting** and the **World Congress of Taiwan Studies**.  

        Methodologically, I employ **quantitative methods, survey research, and survey experiments** to investigate voter evaluations, representation, and legislative behavior.
