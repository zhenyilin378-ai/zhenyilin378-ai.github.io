## About Me
I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Science at the University of Houston.  
My research interests include legislative politics, public opinion, and political behavior, with a focus on how voters perceive and evaluate the behavior of political elites.  
Methodologically, I employ quantitative methods, survey research, and survey experiments.
